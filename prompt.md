You are a senior web performance engineer.

Analyze this Lighthouse report for a landing page website.
I want you to:

1. Identify the TOP 5 performance bottlenecks that cause the score to be low.
2. Tell me which ones affect:
   - LCP
   - TBT
   - CLS
3. Rank them by impact (most damaging first).
4. For each issue, give:
   - Root cause
   - What file or asset is responsible
   - How to fix it in practical terms (not theory)

My goal is to raise Lighthouse Performance from ~60 to 90+ for a sales landing page.

Be direct, technical, and actionable.
